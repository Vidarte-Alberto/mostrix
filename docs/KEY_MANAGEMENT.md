# Key Management and Identity

Mostrix strictly follows the Mostro protocol's key management specifications to ensure privacy, security, and deterministic recoverability of user accounts and trades.

## Deterministic Derivation (NIP-06)

Mostrix uses **BIP-39 mnemonics** and **NIP-06** for deterministic key derivation. In normal user mode, the 12-word mnemonic is generated and stored in the SQLite `users` table on first startup, and `settings.toml` derives `nsec_privkey` from the corresponding identity key (index 0) so DB and settings keys stay in sync. Admin keys are configured separately via `admin_privkey` and can be rotated from the Settings tab.

### Derivation Path
The project uses the standard Mostro derivation path:
`m/44'/1237'/38383'/0/X`

Where `X` is the index:
- **`X = 0`**: Identity Key.
- **`X >= 1`**: Trade Keys.

## Key Rotation and Backup Prompts

The Settings tab includes a **Generate New Keys** option in **User mode** only.

- **User mode**: Mostrix generates a new 12-word mnemonic, deletes/recreates the DB user identity, and updates `settings.toml`’s `nsec_privkey`.
- **Admin mode**: use **Change Admin Key** to paste the Mostro daemon `nsec` into `admin_privkey`. Generating a new admin keypair is not offered — operator actions (e.g. `AdminAddSolver`) require the daemon’s own key.

In the user-mode flow Mostrix shows a backup popup displaying the newly generated 12 words. The mnemonic must be saved, and Mostrix should be restarted after saving so all derived keys and in-memory state use the new values.

On very first launch, when Mostrix must bootstrap a brand-new `settings.toml`, it also shows the backup popup as an overlay on the initial Orders/Disputes tab (it does not force switching to the Settings tab).

## Identity Key (Index 0)

The **Identity Key** is the user's long-term Nostr identity. It is used for:
- Building reputation across the Mostro network.
- Signing the **Seal** (kind 13) in NIP-59 Gift Wrap events in "Normal Mode".
- Acting as the primary point of contact for the Mostro daemon for rating updates.

## Trade Keys (Index 1+)

To maximize privacy, Mostrix derives a **fresh ephemeral trade key** for every new order or taken trade.

- **Role**: Signs the **Rumor** (kind 1) inside the NIP-59 Gift Wrap.
- **Privacy**: Ensures that trades are not easily linkable to the user's primary identity by external observers.

## Admin Shared Keys for Disputes

In admin mode, Mostrix also uses **per‑dispute shared keys** for the dispute chat system. These are not derived directly from the mnemonic path above, but from an ECDH operation between the admin identity key and each party’s trade pubkey.

- **Derivation**:
  - When an admin takes a dispute, the client derives two shared secrets using:
    - The admin secret key (`admin_privkey` from `settings.toml`), and
    - The buyer’s trade pubkey / seller’s trade pubkey from the dispute.
  - ECDH is performed via `nostr_sdk::util::generate_shared_key`, and the resulting bytes are wrapped into a `Keys` instance.
  - These keys are persisted as hex‑encoded secrets in the `admin_disputes` table as:
    - `buyer_shared_key_hex`
    - `seller_shared_key_hex`

- **Usage**:
  - The shared keys act as **per‑(dispute, party) chat identities**:
    - Outgoing admin chat messages are kind 14 signed by `K_sign` (`wrap_chat_message`); `p` = `pub(K_conv)`.
    - Incoming messages are fetched by `authors = [pub(K_sign)]` (kind 14) and, while `CHAT_ACCEPT_LEGACY_GIFTWRAP` is true, also by GiftWrap `#p` = ECDH pubkey.
  - Both admin and counterparty can independently derive the same shared key, mirroring the `mostro-chat` model.
  - Per‑party last‑seen timestamps (`buyer_chat_last_seen`, `seller_chat_last_seen`) are used together with these keys to implement incremental, restart‑safe admin chat sync.

- **Validation**: When saving a new dispute, if buyer and seller pubkeys differ but the two derived shared keys are identical, the client logs an error (`Shared keys for dispute … are identical for different buyer/seller pubkeys; chat may be broken`). This guards against bad relay data or parsing issues. A unit test in `src/util/chat_utils.rs` asserts that different counterparty pubkeys yield different shared keys.

## NIP-59 Gift Wrap Structure (protocol v1)

Mostrix implements NIP-59 for **protocol v1** Mostro DMs. **Protocol v2** Mostro DMs use signed kind 14 via [`wrap_message_with`](../src/util/mod.rs). **P2P / dispute chat** uses kind 14 (`K_sign` / `K_conv`) and dual-reads legacy GiftWrap until `CHAT_ACCEPT_LEGACY_GIFTWRAP` is flipped (see [MESSAGE_FLOW_AND_PROTOCOL.md](MESSAGE_FLOW_AND_PROTOCOL.md)).

### 1. Normal Mode (Reputation Enabled)
In this mode, Mostro can link the trade to your identity key for reputation purposes, but other Nostr users cannot.
- **Wrap (Kind 1059)**: Signed by a random ephemeral key.
- **Seal (Kind 13)**: Signed by the **Identity Key (Index 0)**.
- **Rumor (Kind 1)**: Signed by the **Trade Key (Index N)**.

### 2. Full Privacy Mode
In this mode, Mostro cannot link the trade to your identity key. You operate anonymously without reputation.
- **Wrap (Kind 1059)**: Signed by a random ephemeral key.
- **Seal (Kind 13)**: Signed by the **Trade Key (Index N)**.
- **Rumor (Kind 1)**: Signed by the **Trade Key (Index N)**.

## Trade Index Incrementation
Whenever a user creates or takes an order, the next trade index is reserved atomically in the database before any network I/O.

**Implementation**: `src/util/order_utils/take_order.rs:69`
```69:70:src/util/order_utils/take_order.rs
    // Reserve the next trade index atomically; propagate DB errors (e.g. SQLITE_BUSY).
    let (next_idx, trade_keys) = User::reserve_next_trade_index(pool, 1).await?;
```

The reservation runs in a transaction (`User::reserve_next_trade_index` in `src/models.rs`); a failed commit (e.g. database locked) aborts the operation instead of reusing keys. The same helper is used in `send_new_order` (`none_base = 1`) and range-order `NextTrade` flows (`none_base = 0` in `execute_send_msg`).

## Database Persistence

### Derivation Logic
The derivation logic for trade keys uses the `trade_index` as the child index in the derivation path.

**Implementation**: `src/models.rs:165`
```165:175:src/models.rs
    pub fn derive_trade_keys(&self, trade_index: i64) -> Result<Keys> {
        let account: u32 = NOSTR_ORDER_EVENT_KIND as u32;
        let keys = Keys::from_mnemonic_advanced(
            &self.mnemonic,
            None,
            Some(account),
            Some(trade_index as u32),
            Some(0),
        )?;
        Ok(keys)
    }
```

## Database Persistence

Maintaining the state of trade indices is **critical**. If the `trade_index` associated with an order is lost, the client will be unable to decrypt messages from Mostro or the counterparty for that specific trade.

### The `users` Table
The local SQLite database stores the mnemonic and the latest index used. On first run, `settings.toml`’s `nsec_privkey` is derived from the DB identity key (index 0) corresponding to this mnemonic, so user identity remains deterministic across restarts.

**Source**: `src/db.rs:55`
```55:60:src/db.rs
            CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
                i0_pubkey char(64) PRIMARY KEY,
                mnemonic TEXT,
                last_trade_index INTEGER,
                created_at INTEGER
            );
```

### The `orders` Table
Each order entry also stores the specific `trade_keys` (or the index) used, allowing the client to re-derive the correct key during startup synchronization or when receiving DMs.

## Stateless Recovery Strategy

Mostrix avoids storing full message histories locally. Instead, it uses the deterministic nature of the keys:
1. On startup, the client retrieves all active order IDs and their associated `trade_index` from the database.
2. It re-derives the corresponding `Trade Keys`.
3. It queries Nostr relays for recent **protocol DM** events directed to those trade public keys — GiftWrap (kind 1059) or signed kind 14, depending on the Mostro instance `protocol_version` / [`Transport`](../src/util/mod.rs).
4. Separately, **P2P / dispute chat** is hydrated by the shared-key chat router (kind 14 `authors = [pub(K_sign)]`, plus legacy GiftWrap `#p` while `CHAT_ACCEPT_LEGACY_GIFTWRAP` is true).
5. This allows the client to reconstruct the current state of any active trade without needing a heavy local message database.
